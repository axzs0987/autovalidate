Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to.

Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps.\n\nPenetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment.\n\nPenetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization\u2019s risk assessment": 39410, "11.3 Examine penetration- testing methodology and interview responsible personnel to verify a methodology is implemented and includes at least the following:\nIs based on industry- accepted penetration testing approaches.\nIncludes coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.\nIncludes testing from both inside and outside the network.\nIncludes testing to validate any segmentation and scope reduction controls.\nDefines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5.\nDefines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems.\n\udbff\udc00 Includes review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.\n\udbff\udc00 Specifies retention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.": 39411, "Identify the documented penetration-testing methodology examined to verify a methodology is implemented that includes at least the following:\nBased on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches.\nCoverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.\nTesting from both inside and outside the network.\nTesting to validate any segmentation and scope reduction controls.\nDefines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5.\nDefines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems.\nReview and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.\nRetention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nIdentify the responsible personnel interviewed who confirm the penetration\u2013testing methodology implemented includes at least the following:\nBased on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches.\nCoverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.\nTesting from both inside and outside the network.\nTesting to validate any segmentation and scope reduction controls.\nDefines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5.\nDefines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems.\nReview and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.\nRetention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nDescribe how the penetration-testing methodology was examined to verify that the implemented methodology includes at least the following:\n\nBased on industry-accepted penetration testing approaches.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nCoverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nTesting from both inside the network, and from outside of the network attempting to get in.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nTesting to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nDefines application-layer penetration tests to include, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.5.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nDefines network-layer penetration tests to include components that support network functions as well as operating systems.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nReview and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.\n<Report Findings Here>\n\nRetention of penetration testing results and remediation activities results.\n<Report Findings Here>": 39412, "11.3.1 Perform external penetration testing at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification (such as an operating system upgrade, a sub-network added to the environment, or a web server added to the environment).\n\n": 39413, "Penetration testing conducted on a regular basis and after significant changes to the environment is a proactive security measure that helps minimize potential access to the CDE by malicious individuals.\n\nThe determination of what constitutes a significant upgrade or modification is highly dependent on the configuration of a given environment.

This remains the preferred method even though there are still outstanding issues: \n1.  We do not have any definite specifications on the allowable range of SDNR values to expect although the UK experience does help. This is particularly true of the magnification view. \n2.  The AECs of many machines still seem to be set up aiming for constant image receptor dose.": 55176, "This test requires images made under AEC of 2, 4 and 6 cm thicknesses of PMMA with a 10 mm x 10 mm x 0.2 mm Al foil with its centre about 6 cm from chest wall (3 cm for magnification images) such that the foil left margin is aligned along the central axis (see diagram below). Some manufacturers provide PMMA slabs for QC testing (e.g. GE) that may not be approriate for this test. Rectangular slabs of at least 18 cm \u00d7 24 cm and preferably covering the entire detector should be used. The small Al foil minimises the impact of the heel effect and, importantly with the AEC changing the technique factors because of the presence of the Al. This is particularly an issue with GE units where the AEC controls the exposure based on the signal on a small area of the detector under the most under-penetrated part of the breast or phantom. \n": 55177, "The amount of compression used should be the minimum necessary to trigger the AEC as excessive amounts may cause paddle on chest wall edge to turn upwards, providing an incorrect measure of the compressed breast thickness and hence calling up an inappropriate technique. Any image processing must be turned OFF. The technique factors must be recorded as it is important that these are the same or very similar factors are utilised in the determination of the MGD. In each \u201cfor processing\u201d or raw image the mean pixel value (MPV) and standard deviation (SD), respectively are calculated for ROI1 located next to the Al foil, and ROI2 over the Al foil (both equidistant from the foil left edge). The ROIs used for measurement purposes need to be much smaller that the Al foil, say <0.25 cm^2. The image pixel values must be linearised with respect to dose before the SDNR is calculated. ": 55178, "The table on the next page provides minimum acceptable values of the SDNR in contact mode for 4 cm PMMA based on UK and local experience. We now have sufficient experience to suggest that these numbers and the tolerances for other thicknesses noted on the next page must be achieved in both contact and mag mode. If the medical physicist finds non-compliance then they must undertake further testing to establish AEC settings that will provide compliance. Any recommended changes must be clearly communicated to the site in their report. Finally, it is important to note that the acceptable SDNR values must be obtained within the MGD constraints for contact mode and also within the exposure time limits specified for imaging of 6 cm PMMA.": 55179, "Note: Detector response is referring to the response of the digital mammography image detector and NOT the AEC detector. Thus, exposures are undertaken under manual mAs selection.": 55180, "The \u201cfor processing\u201d (unprocessed or raw) images of a 40 mm PMMA block covering at least the central part of the detector should be acquired under manual control at a clinically relevant kVp and target/filter combination (i.e., those selected under AEC for 40 mm PMMA). The range of mAs values selected should cover the clinically useful range (e.g. 5 to 300 mAs) so that the MPV increases to a value corresponding to about a factor of three above the value obtained using an AEC initiated exposure. The air kerma is measured by placing a dosimeter on or next to the PMMA and approximately 60 mm from the chest wall in the irradiated field in a position that will not influence the subsequent image measurements. In some instances (e.g. Unfors Xi) with Sectra the dosimeter may have to be placed under the PMMA. Measure the MPV (the pixel value offset will be subtracted by the spreadsheet) and SD in a ROI ~ 4cm^2 is drawn centrally along the long axis and approximately 60 mm from the chest wall. ": 55181, "Some limited analysis of image noise is appropriate. This is done by plotting the SD2 against the MPV and fitting a quadratic function of the form:\n\nSD2 = a1 + a2 MPV + a3 MPV2\n\nwhere a1, a2, and a3 represent the relative contributions of electronic, quantum and structure noise, respectively. It should be noted that where manufacturers include a PV offset in their images then this offset must first be subtracted from the measured pixel values before the above plot is undertaken. Siemens, Philips & Hologic have a PV offset of 50 in all images.": 55182, "Manufacturer specific comments:": 55183, "The manufacturer's QC manuals may recommend the technical factors (kVp, filter) to use for this test.\n\nWith the Sectra/Philips the image data may be scaled so that the MPV is essentially constant regardless of dose.
